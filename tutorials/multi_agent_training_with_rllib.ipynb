    "Welcome! This tutorial is the first of a series on doing distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here, we specifically demonstrate how to integrate our multi-agent economic simulation, [Foundation](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist/tree/master/ai_economist/foundation), with [RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib), an open-source library for reinforcement learning. We chose to use RLlib, as it provides an easy-to-use and flexible library for MARL. A detailed documentation on RLlib is available [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We put together these tutorial notebook with the following key goals in mind:\n",
    "- Provide an exposition to MARL. While there are many libraries and references out there for single-agent RL training, MARL training is not discussed as much, and there aren't many multi-agent rl libraries.\n",
    "- Provide reference starting code to perform MARL training so the AI Economist community can focus more on building meaningful extensions to Foundation and better-performant algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following concepts in this tutorial:\n",
    "1. Adding an *environment wrapper* to make the economic simulation compatible with RLlib.\n",
    "2. Creating a *trainer* object that holds the (multi-agent) policies for environment interaction.\n",
    "3. Training all the agents in the economic simulation.\n",

Hence, in position (0, 0), a mobile cannot move \"Left\" or \"Down\", and the corresponding actions in the mask would be nulled out. Now, the RL agent can still recommend to move \"Left\" or \"Down\", but the action isn't really taken.\n",
    "- The key `flat` arises since we set `flatten_observations': True`. Accordingly, the scalar and vector raw observations are all concatenated into this single key. If you're curious to see the entire set of raw observations, do set `flatten_observations': False` in the env_config, and re-run the above cell.\n",

    "The planner sets the tax rates for 7 brackets, each from 0-100% in steps of 5%, so that's 21 values. Adding the NO-OP action brings the planner action space to `MultiDiscrete([22 22 22 22 22 22 22])`."

    "In order to train our economic simulation environment with RLlib, you will need familiarity with one of the key classes: the [`Trainer`](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib-training.html). The trainer object maintains the relationships that connect each agent in the environment to its corresponding trainable policy, and essentially helps in training, checkpointing policies and inferring actions. It helps to co-ordinate the workflow of collecting rollouts and optimizing the various policies via a reinforcement learning algorithm. Inherently, RLlib maintains a wide suite of [algorithms](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib-algorithms.html) for multi-agent learning (which was another strong reason for us to consider using RLlib) - available options include SAC, PPO, PG, A2C, A3C, IMPALA, ES, DDPG, DQN, MARWIL, APEX, and APEX_DDPG. For the remainder of this tutorial, we will stick to using [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/) (PPO), an algorithm known to perform well generally.\n",
